<h1>Islamic Network</h1>
<h3>
A network of free digital Islamic services 
</h3>
<p>
We hope that providing these services will, first and foremost, be pleasing to our Lord.
</p>
<p>
We hope that these can provide a reminder of what is really important in this technology 
obsessed world - to connect with the Real.
</p>
<p>
May Allah Most High accept it and may He always guide us to His Truth.
