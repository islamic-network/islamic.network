# About Islamic Network

Islamic Network started with the Al Adhan (<a href="https://aladhan.com" target="_blank">https://aladhan.com</a>) project as a way to play Adhan 5 times a day.

Alhamdulillah, more services have been added since and Islamic Network services over 100 million HTTP requests a month.

All the code is available as Open Source repositories on <a href="https://github.com/islamic-network" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

If you'd like to learn more about the platform, please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.
